    "# Fruit Classifier Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook trains a machine learning model to classify different types of fruits based on their images. It begins by loading fruit images from a specified directory, extracting the mean RGB color values from each image as features, and associating these features with the corresponding fruit label. Using this data, the notebook trains a Random Forest Classifier to recognize fruits, then saves the trained model as `fruit_classifier_model.pkl` for future use, allowing for quick fruit recognition in applications without needing to retrain the model each time."
